## About

This project was made for the MSA program for the data science option.

My model can predict the `tmpc` found in the weather dataset a month into the future
The dataset `weather-data.csv` is obtained from [IOWA Environmental Mesonet - Iowa State University](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/).
